## <center>Auditory stimulus design</center>
The [GrFNN Toolbox](https://github.com/musicdynamicslab/grfnntoolbox) is a MATLAB toolbox for modeling auditory perception and neurophysiology using nonlinear oscillators. It also has functionality for auditory stimulus design and analysis. Common psychophysical auditory parameters are implemented, such as modulation, ramping, masking, and automation. Visualization is possible in multiple ways, such as spectrograms and autocorrelograms.
